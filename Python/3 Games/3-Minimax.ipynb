    "  names of the players.  It is assumed that the first element in this list represents \n",

    "  of all states that can be reached by any move of `player`.\n",
    "* `utility(State)` takes a state and a player as its arguments.\n",
    "  If `state` is a *terminal state* (i.e. a state where the game is finished), \n",
    "  then the function returns the *value* that this `state` has for `gPlayer[0]`.  Otherwise, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "* `finished(State)` returns `True` if and only if `state` is a terminal state.\n",

    "  her move.\n",
    "* `final_msg(State)` informs the human player about the result of the game.\n",
