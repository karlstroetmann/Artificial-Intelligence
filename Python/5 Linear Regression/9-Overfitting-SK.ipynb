    "## One-Hot Encoding with `pd.get_dummies`\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data (variables that contain label values rather than numbers) into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Python library **pandas**, the function `pd.get_dummies` is the standard tool for performing this transformation. It takes a column of categorical data and expands it into multiple new columns—one for each unique category found in the original column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Unique Categories:** The function scans the specified column to find all unique values (e.g., \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\").\n",
    "2. **Create New Columns:** It creates a new binary column for *each* unique category.\n",
    "3. **Assign Binary Values:**\n",
    "* It places a **1** (or `True`) in the column corresponding to the observation's category.\n",
    "* It places a **0** (or `False`) in all other category columns for that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Baseball Divisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at your specific example regarding the `Division` attribute for baseball players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Original Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a DataFrame of baseball players. One of the columns is `Division`, and it contains three possible values representing the division the team plays in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **W** (Western)\n",
    "* **C** (Central)\n",
    "* **E** (Eastern)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the raw data looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Player | Division |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Player A | W |\n",
    "| Player B | C |\n",
    "| Player C | E |\n",
    "| Player D | W |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Applying `pd.get_dummies`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `pd.get_dummies()` on the `Division` column, pandas creates three new columns, usually prefixed with the original column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting table looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Player | Division_W | Division_C | Division_E |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Player A | **1** | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| Player B | 0 | **1** | 0 |\n",
    "| Player C | 0 | 0 | **1** |\n",
    "| Player D | **1** | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Player A** was in the Western division, so `Division_W` is 1, while `Division_C` and `Division_E` are 0.\n",
    "* **Player B** was in the Central division, so `Division_C` is 1.\n",
    "* **Player C** was in the Eastern division, so `Division_E` is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can now treat these columns as independent numerical features rather than a single text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note: The Dummy Variable Trap\n",
    "\n",
    "In many statistical models (like linear regression), including all three columns creates a problem called **multicollinearity** (or the \"Dummy Variable Trap\"). This happens because the variables are perfectly correlated: if you know a player is *not* in the West and *not* in the Central, you automatically know they *must* be in the East.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we often drop one column (usually the first one) to serve as the \"baseline\" or \"reference\" category. Pandas supports this via the `drop_first=True` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used `drop_first=True` on the example above, the result would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Player | Division_W | Division_E |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Player A | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| Player B | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| Player C | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Player B (Central)** is now represented by 0s in both columns. The model infers that if it's not West and not East, it is Central.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the dataset we are inspecting only has two attributes for the attribute `Division`: `W` and `E`.  There is no player from the Central Division.\n",
    "Hence in our case, the attribute `Division` is replaced with just one new binary attribute `Divion_W`.  If this attribute is `True`, the player is\n",
    "in the `West` divison, else he is in the `East` division."
